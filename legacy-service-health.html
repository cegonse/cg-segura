      <h2>Mapping service health</h2>
      <p>
        This workshop session is designed to help the team reflect about the services they take care of,
        and evaluate their health. A 2~3 hour slot should suffice for this step, but you will have to
        prepare the workshop beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team will have to describe their services through <b>metrics</b>, helping them measure their
        health. These metrics can be both <b>quantitative</b> or <b>qualitative</b>. Depending on your context,
        some metrics will make more sense than others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recommend preparing the workshop with someone who has been working with these systems for a long time.
        They will be able to help you define metrics that the team will find easy to relate to when characterizing
        their services.
      </p>
      <p>
        These metrics carry an associated scoring, mapping their health from best case to worst case. In our workshop,
        we used a simple scoring system ranging 1~4, together with a simple semaphoric color code to help us map metrics
        in a digital whiteboard:
        <ul>
          <li><b>1 (<span style="color: rgb(196, 246, 123)">▣</span>) - Ideal</b> &rarr; As good as it can be. Our north-star regarding how we want our services to be.</li>
          <li><b>2 (<span style="color: rgb(252, 164, 0)">▣</span>) - Acceptable</b> &rarr; Rough around its edges, but perfectly manageable for a production service.</li>
          <li><b>3 (<span style="color: rgb(255, 88, 88)">▣</span>) - Problematic</b> &rarr; Problems are becoming worrying, and could get worse if maintenance is not expedited.</li>
          <li><b>4 (<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(236, 233, 230); -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0.5px;">▣</span>) - All hope is lost</b> &rarr; A ticking time bomb, we are not ready to react if something unexpected happens.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once these metrics are ready, we'll set-up a service / health matrix in our digital whiteboard to let the team discuss and
        assign a score to each one of our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by creating a matrix with all the services, and one by one, let the team
        decide which score makes more sense for each one of the metrics:
      </p>
      <div class="image fit-20">
        <img src="./images/legacy-article/empty-matrix.png" />
        <span>Start with all your services, and the metrics you have chosen.</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Then, start a discussion for each of the services and start assigning a score to each metric. As we'll see in the next section,
        some metrics will be objectively measurable, while others will raise a more heated debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is by design: we want our team to have a healthy discussion about the services we are managing, and give ourselves some time
        to reflect about our work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assign a score from 1~4 (green to black, or the color palette of your liking), and finally assign the aggregated score for each of
        them. A simple scoring formula that worked well is <span class="inline-code">ceil(avg([scores]))</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This formula pulls scores down, ensuring that scores of services with low ranking metrics get pulled low. This helps to bring attention
        to services that need it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's add the scores for the metrics, and calculate the score for each metric:
      </p>
      <div class="image fit-20">
        <img src="./images/legacy-article/filled-matrix.png" />
        <span>All services have been evaluated and assigned a score.</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        With these results, we have a bird's-eye view of the technical state of our teams services, split by each metric. With this framework
        in mind, we will have to define which metrics can be used to measure the health our system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next section, you'll find some example metrics that you can use in your own workshop. And later on,
        we'll review the example case study with a set of metrics that could be good candidates for the workshop.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Quantitative metrics</h2>
      <p>
        Quantitative metrics are those that can be measured from objective data. These can be
        useful to determine how far are your team's services from the goals set by your organization,
        upcoming regulatory requirements, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each metric, you should define which are the measurable points and/or thresholds to set
        the metric's score. For example, consider a metric with four yes/no questions, where "yes" is
        positive (you want to fulfill all items).
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, having a "yes" answer to all points would score a 1 (<span style="color: rgb(196, 246, 123)">▣</span>),
        having a "yes" to three out of four would score a 2 (<span style="color: rgb(252, 164, 0)">▣</span>), and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some examples you can use as a starting point. Some of these metrics can be answered on a
        yes/no basis, others require gathering actual numbers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Obsevability</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Are our systems observable from the outside?</li>
              <li>Are there alarms in place to notify the team in case there is a production failure?</li>
              <li>Is the team able to understand the current state of the system by checking logs and traces?</li>
              <li>Are performance measurements available for our systems?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Security</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Do our systems use libraries or frameworks with known security vulnerabilities?</li>
            <li>Are we running security scanning processes on our systems?</li>
            <li>If so, is the team actively patching found security vulnerabilities?
            <li>Does the team follow security best practices? (masking PII data in logs, properly storing sensitive data and secrets, etc)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Up-to-dateness</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>Are any of our systems using frameworks or libraries out of their maintenance window?</li>
            <li>Are any systems using frameworks that could complicate updating to modern versions if needed? (ex. NET Framework, PHP 5...)</li>
            <li>Do our systems comply with all applicable regulations, in all applicable jurisdictions?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Scalability</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Is the team aware of how do our services perform under load?</li>
              <li>Does the architecture of the systems allow to scale them up when required?</li>
              <li>Can the team scale them autonomously, or do we need support or permission from other teams?</li>
              <li>Are there auto-scaling measures in place?</li>
              <li>Do we perform regular load testing on our services?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Failure Rate</b>
          <ul>
            <li>How often does the service have critical bugs?</li>
            <li>Does the service go down? If so, how long does its recovery take?</li>
            <li>Is the service part of the critical path? Can the business operate without it?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Qualitative metrics</h2>
      <p>
        Qualitative metrics work great to help your team assess how do they "feel" when working with
        their systems. Discussing metrics without factual data to back them might seem counterproductive,
        but in some cases trying to express all problems with hard numbers might complicate the debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main point when discussing through these metrics is ensuring there's a healthy debate during the
        workshop, and come to a common understanding of how does it <i>feel</i> to work with these systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some qualitative metrics you can use are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Extendability</b>
          <ul>
            <li>How easy is it to add new features to our service?</li>
            <li>Are we held back by its architecture and/or design?</li>
            <li>Do we avoid extending the service beyond surgical changes due to accumulated tech debt?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Testing quality</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Are the tests backing our service easy to read and understand?</li>
            <li>Do we trust the results of our tests?</li>
            <li>Is it easy to create new tests?</li>
            <li>Does our test codebase break easily when adding new features?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We could find an objective way of measuring these metrics with hard data. But in many
        cases the debate created around these topics is much more valuable to understand the general
        "vibe" around working with these services, than hard numbers by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you could assess testing quality quantitatively by measuring the code base's coverage,
        the number of flaky tests or the time required to execute a full test suite.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if the architecture supporting these tests makes creating new tests or extending existing
        tests a chore, the team will have an easier time expressing this pain point from a feelings
        point of view. Even though from a numbers perspective, everything seems to be okay.
      </p>

      <h2>Example case study - service health</h2>
      <p>
        Let's go back to our example case study, and define which metrics are most relevant for our services, and how
        to measure them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our service matrix will consist of the four key services our team manages (excluding off-the-shelf
        components). To measure their health, we will use four metrics, two qualitative and two quantitative:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Extendability</b>: How easy is it to extend the service with new features?
            <ul>
              <li><b>1 (<span style="color: rgb(196, 246, 123)">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; Extending the service with new functionality is seamless. New features and improvements take minimal time.</li>
              <li><b>2 (<span style="color: rgb(252, 164, 0)">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; Adding new functionalities can get cumbersome without refactoring first.</li>
              <li><b>3 (<span style="color: rgb(255, 88, 88)">▣</span>) </b> &rarr; The codebase has grown without regard to its architecture, and adding new features is time consuming and a potential risk.</li>
              <li><b>4 (<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(236, 233, 230); -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0.5px;">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; Adding new features is very time consuming, and requires extensive prior clean up through refactoring.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Testing Quality</b>: How good are the tests supporting development of the service?
            <ul>
              <li><b>1 (<span style="color: rgb(196, 246, 123)">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; Tests are well maintained, comprehensive and robust. Includes functional and non-functional testing, stress tests, etc...</li>
              <li><b>2 (<span style="color: rgb(252, 164, 0)">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; There is decent test coverage, but their design makes them prone to breaking.</li>
              <li><b>3 (<span style="color: rgb(255, 88, 88)">▣</span>) </b> &rarr; There are some tests, but not coverage isn't good enough to allow changes without risk.</li>
              <li><b>4 (<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(236, 233, 230); -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0.5px;">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; There are no tests, and adding new tests would take a lot of effort at this point.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Failure Rate</b>: How often does the system fail? How long does it take to recover?
            <ul>
              <li><b>1 (<span style="color: rgb(196, 246, 123)">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; Asd asd.</li>
              <li><b>2 (<span style="color: rgb(252, 164, 0)">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; Asd asd.</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Security & Up-to-Date</b>: Does the service follow security best practices? Are its dependencies up to date?
            <ul>
              <li><b>1 (<span style="color: rgb(196, 246, 123)">▣</span>)</b> &rarr; Asd asd.</li>
